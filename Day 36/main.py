## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co
stock_key = os.environ['ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY']

url = 'https://www.alphavantage.co/query'
parameters = {

df['pct_change'] = df['close'].pct_change()

print(df[abs(df['pct_change']) > 0.05])

# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
