<h1>Password Manager App</h1>
This is a simple yet powerful password manager application developed in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to generate secure passwords, save login credentials, and store them locally on their machine.

<h3>Password Complexity Options</h3>

- Specify the desired number of characters for lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols.
- Use only digits for customization.

<h3>Important Notes</h3>
